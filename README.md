> This project has been on pause for 2 years - resuming development soon!

A comprehensive school management system born from the chaos of a running 3k+ secondary school on paper and uh...

## The Problem

My secondary school had over 3,0000 students and was doing everything manually. Result processing took forever, tracking who paid school fees was a nightmare, managing records was tedious. Basically every administrative process you can think of was painful and inefficient.

## The Solution

TAEMS is designed as a cloud-based platform to handle:

- **Result Processing** - Automated grade compilation and report generation
- **Fee Management** - Track payments across thousands of students  
- **Student Records** - Comprehensive student information system
- **Staff Management** - Payroll automation and staff coordination
- **Performance Analytics** - Student progress tracking and insights
- **Digital-first approach** - Cut down on paper waste and manual processes

## Current Status

This project has been on hold for about 2 years now..

- I got an internship that required my full attention
- Welps, school commitments
- Decided to move away from Python to expand my skillset & get better and other things
- Generally got busy with life and other learning priorities

But here's the thing - I'm definitely coming back to finish this. The time away has been valuable. I've gotten way better at building software systems, understand how things should work much better now, and I'm excited to apply the new toolset I've acquired to this project.

## What's Next Then?

Development is resuming soon with:

- Better system architecture
- Modern dev stuff  
- Improved user experience
- Pretty much the same goal but executed much better

## Previous Work

For a look at where things were 2 years ago, check out this video walkthrough:

The foundation was pretty solid, but I know I can do so much better now.

*This isn't just another school management system - it's solving real problems I lived through. Can't wait to get back to it.*
